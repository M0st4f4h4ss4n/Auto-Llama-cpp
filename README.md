<h2>Memory/Disk Requirements ðŸ’¾</h2>
<p>As the models are currently fully loaded into memory, you will need adequate disk space to save them and sufficient RAM to load them. At the moment, memory and disk requirements are the same.</p>

<h2>Quick Tutorial ðŸš€</h2>
<p>Hi! I ended up trying this out recently and found a few issues but submitted a pull request for it. Here's a quick tutorial of what I did on how to get it up and running with my changes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Run these commands:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/rhohndorf/Auto-Llama-cpp.git
cd Auto-Llama-cpp
pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://huggingface.co/eachadea/legacy-ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit/resolve/main/ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit.bin">ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit.bin (8GB)</a> and place it in your models folder (for testing I made one in the root directory of this project with another folder called 13B for the size but if you're trying out multiple llms you'll likely have a folder somewhere else for all of them).</li>
<li>Rename "env.template" file to ".env" changing any environment variables that you need (like the path to your recently downloaded model).</li>
<li>Run this command to start:
<pre><code>python scripts/main.py</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Once you have things running and can see what it does, try changing ai_settings.yml and scripts/data/prompt.txt to change how the AI behaves.</li>
</ol>
