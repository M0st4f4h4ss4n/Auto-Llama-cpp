    <h1>ü¶ô Auto-Llama-cpp: An Autonomous Llama Experiment ü¶ô</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to the Auto-Llama-cpp fork! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for users who want to explore and work with LLaMA models. The Auto-Llama-cpp project is an extension of Auto-GPT, with added support for locally running LLaMA models through llama.cpp. As a proof of concept, it demonstrates the potential of running smaller LLaMA models on local machines, despite its limitations in terms of speed and context window size.</p>
    <p>This Learn.md file will serve as a guide to understanding and using the Auto-Llama-cpp project effectively. By the end of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of the project, its components, and how to run it on your local machine.</p>
    <h2>üåê Overview</h2>
    <p>The Auto-Llama-cpp repository contains two main components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Auto-Llama-cpp</strong>: The primary project that allows you to run LLaMA models locally using llama.cpp.</li>
        <li><strong>llama.cpp</strong>: A separate project that focuses on the inference of LLaMA models in pure C/C++ without external dependencies.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>üìö Supported Models</h2>
    <p>The Auto-Llama-cpp project works with a variety of LLaMA models, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LLaMA</li>
        <li>Alpaca</li>
        <li>GPT4All</li>
        <li>Chinese LLaMA / Alpaca</li>
        <li>Vigogne (French)</li>
        <li>Vicuna</li>
        <li>Koala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>üöÄ Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with the Auto-Llama-cpp project, follow these steps:</p>
